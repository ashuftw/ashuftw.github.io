<div class="date" style="text-align: right;">12 June, 2020</div>


<style>
.centered {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: left;
    min-height: 80vh;
    text-align: left;
}
</style>

<div class="centered">

If we could touch the clouds, I would never let go.<br>
I would drift wherever the wind took me and<br>
call it home.<br>
But if I had to leave, I would fall down as rain<br>
on the pale blue dot<br>
as a pale blue dot.<br>
Then rise again and be one with the sky

</div>
