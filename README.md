Ahoy! I'm [Ashu][1]. I study Computational Science at [TU-Braunschweig][2]. Currently I'm a Student Research Assistant in the [Multiphase Flows and Icing][3] work group at the [Institut für Strömungsmechanik][4]. 

The purpose of this website is to I share things that I'm interested and excited about.
