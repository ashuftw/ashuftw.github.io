- Self improvement. I accept that I am fundamentally flawed. The pursuit to be better is the beginning and the end. 

- Practicing [color blindness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxB3b7fxMEA){:target="_blank"} in my personal life. 

- Saying no. 

- Being yourself and having that be a self selecting criteria for the people who want to be around you.

- Question dogma and identifiction with a particular philosophy or group. One should be very suspicious if all your beliefs fit into neatly prepackaged [boxes](https://fs.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Naval-Ravikant-TKP.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

- The Universe loves you because you belong to it. 

- Anger is useless. 

- Kids should be taken seriously and treated as equals. I remember being a kid, wanting to punch adults who dumbed down or act retarded when speaking to me. Kids can see through your bullshit. 

- Love is fundamental to being. Love is responsibility, kindness, service, gratitude, companionship, belonging, acceptance, grace, beauty, discipline and attention.
